curzilla is a curses-based front-end for [mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/).
Currently it is very basic; it does not do most things that one would expect.
Licensed under both the MPL and GPL, since from what I understand that's what the rest of mozilla is licensed under.
If I'm wrong about that, then the license is whatever mozilla's license is.
As far as I'm concerned, mozilla.org owns this code.

I've stopped working on this because it would require too many changes to the layout engine, but if you don't mind severe rendering bugs then it's probably a good base.
