So here's how you get apply everything that's in this directory, and get as far
as I've gotten:

1. Get the client.mk file:

~ $ cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:2401/cvsroot co -f mozilla/client.mk

2. Put the .mozconfig file that exists in this directory into the mozilla/ directory just created

3. Pull the rest of the sources:

~/mozilla $ make -f client.mk checkout

4. Apply the diff:

~/mozilla $ patch -p0 <../diff

5. Put the directories in their places:

gfx/ becomes mozilla/gfx/src/curses/
widget/ becomes mozilla/widget/src/curses/
viewer/ becomes mozilla/webshell/tests/viewer/unix/curses/

6. Build everything:

~/mozilla $ make -f client.mk build

7. Run the viewer application:

~/mozilla/dist/bin $ ./run-mozilla.sh ./viewer [ url ]

So that's really it.

You have to keep in mind, this is mostly just a sick joke. It won't ever be
correct, no matter how intelligent the gfx section is, because the layout
engine has the underlying assumption that the gfx engine is not character-based
but graphics-based. For example, layout thinks can have a row of text that's
ten pixels high and three pixels below it (just enough for a table, say)
another row of text that's ten pixels. So this is mostly only useful for
laughing at, and actually is a pretty good base for starting a new backend for
a graphics-based system (say, ggi or something). But don't think you're ever
going to get a curses-based mozilla without severely rewriting the layout
engine.
